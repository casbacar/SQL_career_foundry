Rockbuster Stealth, a global movie rental company similar to the former Blockbuster, has launched a strategic data analysis initiative to shape its business direction for 2020. The company's management board is seeking to understand key performance metrics across their operations, including which movies in their extensive catalog generate the most revenue, how long customers typically keep their rentals, and where their customer base is located worldwide. This analysis is particularly focused on identifying their most valuable customers' locations and understanding how sales perform across different geographic regions. By examining these crucial business metrics, Rockbuster aims to make data-driven decisions to enhance their market presence, optimize their inventory, and develop targeted strategies for customer retention and expansion in an evolving entertainment market. This comprehensive analysis will serve as a foundation for the company's strategic planning, ensuring their business model remains competitive in the digital age.
